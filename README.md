# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects (DRAFT)

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my journey in the world of data science and machine learning. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I have created, along with those I plan to develop in the future. Each project is a stepping stone in my continuous learning and exploration of various data science techniques and methodologies.

## Current Projects

### 1. Project Name: Predicting Bike Demand
**Description**: This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes using various machine learning algorithms. Key factors such as temperature, weather conditions, and holidays are analyzed to build an accurate predictive model.
**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
**Link to Project**: [Predicting Bike Demand](link-to-project)

### 2. Project Name: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media
**Description**: In this project, I analyze social media posts to determine the sentiment of users towards specific topics. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
**Technologies**: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, WordCloud
**Link to Project**: [Sentiment Analysis](link-to-project)

## Upcoming Projects

### 1. Project Name: House Price Prediction
**Description**: This project will focus on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to develop a regression model that provides accurate price predictions.
**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn

### 2. Project Name: Customer Segmentation
**Description**: This project will involve clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The aim is to understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Conclusion

This repository will feature all the significant milestones in my data science learning journey. I will continuously update it with new projects and improvements on existing ones. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and collaborate. Thank you for visiting!
